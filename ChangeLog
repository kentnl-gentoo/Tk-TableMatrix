2002-02-13 07:00  cerney

	tkTableCmds.c, tkTableWin.c: Reverted back to the cell sorting
	method implemented in tktable 2.5 (and TableMatrix 0.3).  The new
	cell sorting method didn't sort negative row/column indexes
	correctly, which caused the data from a copy/paste operation to be
	out-of-order, if the selection included multiple negative row/col
	indexes.

2001-06-05 12:12  cerney

	* TableMatrix/Spreadsheet.pm, demos/TableMatrixSpreadsheetTest,
	t/create.t: Added TableMatrix::Spreadsheet. TableMatrix Derived
	object with excel-like bindings

2000-12-24 13:01  cerney

	* pTk/: Makefile.PL, mTk/Tktable/tkTable.c: Fixed Version in
	pTk/Makefile.PL Removed the hard-coded forceupdate=1 in tkTable.c
	to reduce the flashing seen when updating the cursor. This may have
	other side effects... needs to be watched.

2000-10-31 21:40  cerney

	* pTk/mTk/Tktable/tkTable.c: Modified to keep the selection around
	for incremental selection gets. This helps speed up getting the
	selection, esp for large area selects.
	
	Added setting the cursor to 'watch' when getting the selection. For
	large selection areas this can take some time, so setting the
	cursor to watch will at least notify the user that something is
	happening.

2000-10-26 16:14  cerney

	* pTk/mTk/Tktable/tkTableCellSort.c: Fixed the sorting routine to
	work with perl/tk
