	* pTk/mTk/Tktable/tkTable.c: Modified to keep the selection around
	for incremental selection gets. This helps speed up getting the
	selection, esp for large area selects.
	Added setting the cursor to 'watch' when getting the selection. For
	large selection areas this can take some time, so setting the
	cursor to watch will at least notify the user that something is
        happening.
