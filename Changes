Release 0.71:  6/15/01

* Fixed to compile with the new Tk800.023 release.

Release 0.7:  6/7/01

* Added TableMatrix::Spreadsheet widget. This is a TableMatrix Derived
        widget with Excel-like bindings.

* Reverted back to the cell sorting method implemented in tktable 2.5 (and
	TableMatrix 0.3).  The new cell sorting method didn't sort negative
	row/column indexes correctly, which caused the data from a
	copy/paste operation to be out-of-order, if the selection included
        multiple negative row/col indexes.
	
* Fixed control +/- key bindings for modifying the column with.
